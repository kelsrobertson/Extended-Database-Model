# Extended-Database-Model
An advanced SQL database that extends a foundational schema to include additional tables, relationships, and constraints. This project demonstrates scalable database design, modular schema evolution, and enhanced functionality for complex applications.

## Overview
This SQL project is an extended version of a base relational database, designed to support additional functionality and improved structure. It introduces new entities, relationships, or constraints to expand upon an existing systemâ€”ideal for demonstrating advanced schema design and scalable data modeling.

## Database Schema Highlights
- Extended tables for additional functionality (e.g., new user fields, transaction logs, or advanced categories)
- Support for new relationships (e.g., many-to-many mappings or audit trails)
- More refined constraints and indexing for performance optimization
